        <h2>Associating processes with rights</h2>
        <p>
            This section outlines how to indicate existing applicable data subject rights associated with a process,
            using DPV and the EU GDPR extension to represent rights available under the GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
            A process can be used to express information regarding the what, how, where, who, and why personal data 
            is being processed, as well as what rights exist. 
            For indicating applicable GDPR rights, DPV's
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr" target="_blank">EU GDPR extension</a> 
            provides a mapping between legal bases and the applicable data subject rights.
            This pattern can be followed by data controllers
            to express which rights are applicable, including rights beyond the ones in the GDPR, e.g., 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/rights" target="_blank">EU's fundamental rights</a>
            and the rights depicted in other EU regulations or in other jurisdictions.

        <h2>Notifying rights-related activities</h2>
        <p>
            This section outlines how to provide notices related with rights exercising management.
            Generic <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightNotice" target="_blank">right notices</a>
            can be provided to indicate which rights exist, when and where they are applicable, and other relevant information.
            Notices can be associated with specific processes or activities using the 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#hasNotice" target="_blank">hasNotice</a> property.
            <code>dcterms:issued</code> and <code>dcterms:valid</code> can be used to indicate temporal information
            related to notices, i.e., when it was issued and until when it is valid.
            Descriptions and identifiers of the notices and their creators/publishers can be recorded using 
            <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata Terms</a>.
            The notices should also include information about the data controller as well as the entity implementing the notice,
            which can be the data controller or another entity acting on behalf of the data controller,
            using <code>dpv:hasDataController</code> and <code>dpv:isImplementedByEntity</code>, respectively.
            <code>foaf:page</code> can be used to indicate a document, e.g., Webpage, containing the contents of the
            notice and further functionalities.

            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr" target="_blank">EU GDPR extension</a> 
            provides concepts for 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#DirectDataCollectionNotice" target="_blank">direct</a> and 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#IndirectDataCollectionNotice" target="_blank">indirect</a>
            data collection notices, required by GDPR's Articles 13 and 14, respectively, 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#SARNotice" target="_blank">Subject Access Request (SAR) notices</a>
            to fulfil GDPR Right of Access, and
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#RightsRecipientsNotice" target="_blank">recipient notices</a>
            to fulfil GDPR's Art.19 notification requirements, regarding the recipients to whom a rights exercise 
            has been communicated, such as the right to rectification (Art.16), right to erasure (Art.17) or right to restriction 
            of processing (Art.18).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of GDPR's Articles 13 and 14, the data subject should be notified of the identity and contacts of the 
            data controller and of the controller's representative if applicable, as well as receive notice of the contact details 
            of the controller's data protection officer. The notice should also include the purposes and legal basis for data 
            processing, and, in case such basis is the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, said
            interests should be specified. Data subjects should also be made aware of any recipients or categories of recipients
            of the personal data, and, if applicable, about transfers of personal data to a third country or international 
            organisation, including the existence or absence of an adequacy decision for said country and applicable safeguards.
            Furthermore, data subjects should be notified with regards to the data storage period, as well as their existing rights,
            namely the rights to withdraw consent and to lodge a complaint and the rights of access, rectification, erasure, 
            restriction of processing, object and data portability.
            In case the provision of personal data is necessary for statutory or contractual obligations or there is automated 
            decision-making, it should also be disclosed to the data subject.
            Beyond the previously mentioned information, GDPR's Article 14 also requires the data subject to be notified about
            processed categories of data and their respective sources.

        </div>
        <p>
            In the case of the SAR notice, a DPV process can be used to notify the data subject about the type of personal data 
            being processed, the purpose for the processing, and to which recipients it was disclosed.
            The storage period of the data is also indicated, as well as the existence of other data subject rights 
            and the source of the data if not collected from the data subject.
            In case there is automated decision-making, it should also be disclosed to the data subject.

            According to GDPR's Articles 13, 14, and 15, in the case data is shared with any recipients, these can be notified to the
            data subject by their category type instead of naming each recipient individually. DPV currently does not have 
            such a taxonomy. Can we reuse an existent one or should we define one in DPV itself?

            According to GDPR's Articles 13, 14, and 15, in the case of the existence of automated decision-making, 
            including profiling, the data subject must be informed about it when exercising its right of access.
            While DPV already includes concepts to model automation and decision-making, work still needs to be done to 
            come up with a model to represent information <i>"about the logic involved, as well as the significance and

        <h2>Recording rights being exercised</h2>
        <p>
            This section outlines the information that needs to be recorded and maintained when a concrete 
            instance of a right was or is being exercised. Keeping such records is of interest to data controllers 
            to have machine-readable information about the status and fulfillment of requests, which can be used, 
            e.g., by auditors. To represent concrete records of rights being exercised, the 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseRecord" target="_blank">RightExerciseRecord</a> concept, 
            a subclass of DPV's  <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#Record" target="_blank">Record</a>, 
            can be used to associate a particular request, or even distinct requests from the same data subject, 
            with corresponding activities exercised by entities towards fulfilling such requests, modelled as 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseActivity" target="_blank">RightExerciseActivity</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Rights exercise activities</h3>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseActivity" target="_blank">RightExerciseActivity</a>
            represents an instantiation of an activity being performed towards the exercising of a right.
            Such activity instances should include metadata, e.g., timestamps, duration, or involved
            entities, to track the provenance of a particular right exercising process, from the request itself to
            its acknowledgement by the data controller and to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of the right.
            For easy record-keeping, each activity should be modelled as a
            A <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseActivity" target="_blank">RightExerciseActivity</a> instance,
            which can be connected with other instances using DPV's
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isBefore" target="_blank">isBefore</a> and
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#isAfter" target="_blank">isAfter</a> concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to justify a certain right exercise activity, DPV contains a 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/justifications" target="_blank">Justification</a> extension to
            <i>"enable representing specific justifications associated with non-fulfilment, non-requirement, 
            delays, and exercising reasons involved in processes"</i>, which can be used to justify the 
            non-fulfilment, non-requirement, delays, and exercising of rights.
        </p>
        <div class="issue" title="Associate justification with GDPR provision">
            How to connect a justification associated with a right exercising activity with the the GDPR
            provision that inspired its definition?
            The <code>dcterms:source</code> property can be used:
            <pre class="nohighlight">
                ex:RightExerciseActivity a dpv:RightExerciseActivity ;
                    ...
                    dpv:hasJustification ex:Justification .

                ex:Justification a justifications:FreedomOfExpressionImpaired ;
                    dcterms:source "GDPR Article 17.3(a)"^^xsd:string .
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Additionally, to track the status of rights exercising activities, DPV's
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RequestStatus" target="_blank">RequestStatus</a> concepts, including 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RequestAccepted" target="_blank">RequestAccepted</a> 
            for a request being accepted towards fulfilment,
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RequestRejected" target="_blank">RequestRejected</a> 
            for a request being rejected towards non-fulfilment or
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RequestRequiresAction" target="_blank">RequestRequiresAction</a> 
            for a request requiring an action to be performed from another party.
            <a href="#status">Figure 1</a> illustrates the sequence in which these concepts occur. Once the request 
            is initiated, it should be then acknowledged by the entity implementing it and either accepted towards fulfilment
            or rejected towards non-fulfilment. Additionally, after being rejected, the entity fulfilling the
            request can also require further action from the requester (e.g., request additional data to be able
            to fulfil the request), which can delay the acceptance or rejection of the request, and after the
            required action is performed, the request can either be accepted towards fulfilment or get rejected
            again towards non-fulfilment or towards asking again for further action.

        </figure>
        <p>
            DPV's concepts can be used in conjunction with the 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank">W3C's PROV-O recommendation</a>
            to track the provenance of a right exercising activity instance. Using this
            standard, provenance information, regarding the entities whom the activity is associated with, i.e.,
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasAssociatedWith" target="_blank">prov:wasAssociatedWith</a>, 
            or what data/notice was generated, i.e., 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#generated" target="_blank">prov:generated</a>,
            by the right exercise activity, can be represented. 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#actedOnBehalfOf" target="_blank">prov:actedOnBehalfOf</a> can also be
            used to represent delegation or representation, for instance when a parent exercises a right on behalf of its child. 
            Similarly to notices, temporal information, descriptions and identifiers of the activities and their
            creators/publishers can be recorded using <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata Terms</a>.

            In this section, we include examples of rights exercising activities covering the lifecycle of statuses of requests,
            using an exercised GDPR right of access as an example.

            <p>
                Example of a right exercising activity related to a GDPR right of access request. The activity 
                associated with the start of the request has the status <code>dpv:RequestInitiated</code>, 
                the data subject is identified using the <code>dpv:hasDataSubject</code> property and the recipient of the request, 
                a data controller, using <code>dpv:hasRecipientDataController</code>. Furthermore, a process instance
                can be used to express what personal data needs to be processed for the fulfilment of the right -
                in this case, an account identifier of the data subject will be collected and stored by the data controller
                for identity verification purposes. DPV's <code>hasScope</code> can also be used to specify the scope of the 
                request, e.g., the data subject only wants to access data processed for service provision purposes during 2022.

        <p>
            Moreover, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/" target="_blank">DCAT</a> can be used to model resources 
            beyond notices, for instance, a copy of the personal data, which is required in both GDPR's access and data
            portability rights. DCAT promotes the usage of the properties such as <code>dcterms:format</code>, 
            <code>dcterms:valid</code>, and <code>dcat:landingPage</code> to include information regarding the format, validity 
            and dataset provision location, respectively, to characterize the dataset in question.
            Additionally, DCAT promotes the usage of ODRL to express license and rights statements, by linking the dataset with 
            an ODRL policy using the <code>odrl:hasPolicy</code> property, or the usage of DCMI Metadata Terms' <code>license</code>,
            <code>accessRights</code> or <code>rights</code> properties to link datasets with licenses, access rights statements
            or other types of rights statements, e.g., copyrights, respectively. The latter can be used to express 'high-level'
            access control statements, e.g., embargoed, restricted or open access, while the former has the advantage of also being
            a W3C Recommendation, for policy expression, which provides a model to represent complex policies and an easy mechanism
            to extend its model to cover other use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Section, the GDPR's Right of Access is used as an example to showcase how to model right exercising activities 
            using DPV, DCMI Metadata Terms, PROV-O and DCAT. However, a similar pattern can be followed by data controllers to 
            fulfil the other rights as in most cases the only substantial change would be the notice concept that needs to be used 
            for a particular right instance, e.g., <code>eu-gdpr:DirectDataCollectionNotice</code> for the right fulfilment notice
            related to GDPR's Article 13, <code>eu-gdpr:IndirectDataCollectionNotice</code> for the right
            fulfilment notice related to GDPR's Article 14 or <code>eu-gdpr:RightsRecipientsNotice</code>
            for the right fulfilment notice related to GDPR's Article 19.
            Additionally, the proposed model for right exercising activities is generic enough to support the representation of rights
            from other jurisdictions and can be easily extended if the need arises.

            As previously mentioned,
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#RightExerciseRecord" target="_blank">RightExerciseRecord</a>s 
            can be used to associate a particular request, or even distinct requests from the same data subject,
            with corresponding activities exercised by entities towards the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of such requests,
            e.g., using the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasPart" target="_blank">dcterms:hasPart</a> property.

            This section outlines how to use DPV and the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) 
            for data subjects to send right requests in a machine-exercisable format to data controllers, 
            which can integrate an automated response in their rights management processes
